# Better Professor Web API
Better Professor links mentors to students. It allows mentors to keep track of student projects, feedback, and letter of recomendations. Mentors can add students they are mentoring, and students can add projects they are working on. Mentors may add trackers to remind them of upcoming deadlines about their students. Mentors and students may also message each other.
